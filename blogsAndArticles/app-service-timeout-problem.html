<h4>How to solve the 240 seconds app service timeout limit for standard users</h4>
<p>

While working in Azure we stumbled a problem what at the time we thought could not be solved.<br>
We had our main application running on App Service, and for standard account, there is a timeout of 240 seconds for a response to it.<br>
As we were growing in clients, we started working with clients that their response time was bigger. It started to be a big problem. We couldn't serve some big clients because of it.<br>
We could've become a premium account, but before doing that, we wanted to try to find other solution.<br>

The first step was to devide everything up, to understand what solution can be used, or how can I group services to solve this.<br>
---<br>
First thing are the containers that App service runs - <span class="names1">Container Instances</span>, can be used. <br>
To make it work, what we need is the pipeline that build the images - and then running the containers from that images.<br>
Then we can use Application gateway. It can be connected to any compute service, in this case a container. We can put the container instance as the backend and define application gateway with whatever timeout we want.<br>
When I checked it (at about the start of April 2022) you can put the timeout to be at least 10 mins. <br>
To check it you can create a little application that waits as long as you want. I created this:<br>
<div class="code">
	from flask import Flask<br><br>
	from time import sleep<br>
	app = Flask(__name__)<br><br>
	@app.route("/")<br>
	def hello_world():<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep(&lt;n>)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;return "Hello, world!"<br>
</div><br>
Instead of &lt;n> write whatever time you want it to wait, and make the application gateway timeout bigger than that.<br>
Run it:<br>
<div class="command">
	>> export FLASK_APP=&lt;file_name><br>
	>> flask run
</div>
For example I put 600 seconds for 10 minutes in the flask application ad 660 in the timeout of application gateway.<br>
---<br>
<span class="h3-text">Pipeline step</span><br>
Now you should create a pipeline that does everything you want<br>
You can look at the pipeline <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amiriry/Devops/main/Cloud/Azure/AzurePipelines/appservice-replacement.yaml" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>

		Move the npmrc file to the local path of where the pipeline is running.<br>

		Download the artifact created before with: <span class="names1">DownloadPipelineArtifact@2</span><br>

		Last stage - Run the container and connect it to the application gateway<br>

		To be able to run it I need to use a service connection that enables connection to resource - <span class="names1">azurerm-connection</span> in this case.<br>
		I provide a script type with the value of <span class="names1">scriptType</span>- in this case bash.<br>
		And then I do the script itself, writing it after <span class="names1">inlineScript:</span><br>
		• <span class="names1">file1_envfile</span> - The path to the file that contains all environment variables of the container that will be initialized.<br>
		• <span class="names1">registrypass</span> - a secret that is defined in the variable group - 'groupname' - in the begining of the file. You use the secrets there in correspondence to their hirarchy - this secret is stored directly in the group, so it doesn't have a prefix, only the name.<br>
		<span class="names1">az container create</span>... - The command to create a container with all the information from above. I take the image that was created in stage before. Using the registry username and password, which can be achieved from within azure. Use Private ip address so it will be accessible only from my vnet. <br>
		<span class="names1">--command-line</span> - Start the command by login to azure, using the identity which is mentoined in the next parameter. Only then I can run the app with npm.<br>
		Using port 443, with myvnet, and subnet that the container instance is in with the assigned identity inside the quotes (not mentioned here), and the environment variables in one line, which I can get by printing the file with env variables from above and using <span class="command">xargs</span> which print all of them in one line.<br>
	</div>
</div>
After starting the container, I need its IP, to connect to Application Gateway. So I did the command:<br>
<span class="command">az container show -g my-resourcegroup --name my-container --query ipAddress.ip -o tsv</span><br>
This will query only the ip of the container that I created before.<br><br>
To finish the task, I need to put the IP that I found as a backend to the existing application gateway. So:<br>
<span class="command">az network application-gateway address-pool update -g my-resourcegroup --gateway-name my-appgw -n my-bp --servers $ACI_IP</span><br>
I update the address-pool of the application gateway that I created which, which is named <span class="names1">my-bp</span>  with the servers(compte resource) <span class="names1">$AC_IP</span> - which is the IP of the container that I created.
