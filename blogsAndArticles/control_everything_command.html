<h4>Create Your Own Command - Control Everything With It</h4>
</p>

<p>
Everyone that use linux knows about the function of scripts - Do regular repeated stuff. <br>
What about a lot very small things that you do a lot but that don't live in one continuoum? <br>
Like for example:<br>
If you have a lot of directories that you enter regularly and live in a very long path that you have to remember and anyway yse TAB to autocomplete.<br>
Specific Examples: <br>
You have:<br>
Project directory that lives in <span class="code">/home/username/work/projects/devops/ci/jenkins/project_name</span><br>
More general information on your work and tasks that lives in <span class="code">/home/username/Documents/work/projects/project_name</span><br>
General scripts for daily use in <span class="code">/home/username/bin</span><br>
And a lot more...
</p>
You don't remember all paths, and you don't want to press <TAB> for each directory, because if you have 2 directories with the same prefix it starts to be a problem and if you have a lot more than 2 it becomes realy frustrating.<br>
So what's the solution?<br>
<h4>Create a command with automcompletion that does everything for you</h4>
<hr>
First of all you want the script to be autocompleted in the easiest way. <br>
What do I mean by that?<br>
You want the script name to start with letters that no other command have. Like if its starts with ls, you will have a lot commands what can be autocompeted to.<br>
Second you want it to be written easily. So a line in the keyboad will be a good solution.<br>
I chose to call the command <span class="code">poiuytrewq</span> <br>
No other command starts with 'poi', it in the basic linux commands, so it will be autocompleted, very easy.<br>
Second, if I do need to write it, or remember it, it is very easy to remember and write.If I create another script/command that starts with 'poi' it will never be a straight line. <br>

What do I mean by that?<br>
Let's assume you have a script that does 'goto' to the paths above <br>
project
So the commands will be:<br>
<span class="code">poiuytrewq goto projectsdevops</span><br> 
<span class="code">poiuytrewq goto projectsinfo</span><br> 
<span class="code">poiuytrewq goto mycommands</span><br> 
So to get to devops projects dir you only have to do<br> 
<span class="code">poi + TAB + g + TAB + p + TAB + d + TAB</span><br> 
To get to documents of projects <br> 
<span class="code">poi + TAB + g + TAB + p + TAB + i + TAB</span><br> 
To get to commands <br> 
<span class="code">poi + TAB + g + TAB + c + TAB</span> <br>
