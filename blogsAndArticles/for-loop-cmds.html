<h4 class="post_title">How to use for loop in a command</h4>
<p>
the basic usage for 'for' loops in bash is to use them in a script like<br>
<div class="code">
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6...N<br>
do<br>
	some deeds<br>
	...<br>
done
</div>
<br>
</p>
<p>
But there is another thing you can do with it, which I think makes everything much easier to do in linux.<br>
Lets assume you have something repetitive to do.<br>
You have 19 git repositories to add the same, commit and push.
One way it can be done is with getting into each repo and do 
</p>
<div class="code">
	cd dir_name <br>
	git add file_name <br>
	git commit -m "some commit message" <br>
	git push <br>
</div><br>
If you have to do it 19 times (or more) its very much exahusting.<br>
There is a solution for that, with one command only.<br>
Create a directory and clone all 19 repos into it
<span class="code">mkdir reposdir</span> and then
<span class="code">git clone $repos_name</span>
<br>
Then there is only one command you can do (you can also use it in the clone process):<br>
<div class="code">
for d in $(ls); do cd $d; git add file_name; git commit -m "adding the file"; git push; cd ../;done
</div><br>
Now with one command you did everything!<br><hr>
<span class="code">for d in $(ls)</span> - Like when you use it in scripts, you can use the $() operator to take the output of a command and go over it with for loop. In this case, You go over the content of the <span class="for line2">current directory, which is the directory where all the cloned repos are.</span><br>
<span class="code">do cd $d</span> - Get into the directory that the loop is currently on, in this case, one of the directories in the current durectories (=one of the projects)<br>
<span class="code">git add add $file_names<br>
	git commit -m "$message"</span> - add files to the working directory and commit them.<br>
<span class="code">git push</span> - push to the remote repository<br>
<span class="code">cd ../</span> - Very important part! You have to go back one directory for the next iteration to go to the next directory - that's the only way this command can work. Otherwise you will stay in <span class="cd line2">the directory and won't be able to find the next project.</span><br>
<span class="code">done</span> - This is how a loop ends. <br>

<br>
<h2>Summary</h3>
<p>
You can use this method in a lot of placements where you need a little loop, or for any reptitive task, that you can print the variables of it to the screen. Just put it in the output of the command inside $() and do whatever you want with it.
</p>

<h4>Examples</h5>
Doing things on specific pods:<br>
<span class="code">for s in $(kubectl get pods | awk '{print $1}' | egrep "pod1|pod2...");do echo $s:; kubectl logs $s;echo;done</span><br>

Check if a file exists in an archive file:
<span class="code">for f in $(tar -tvf mytar.tar.gz | awk '{print $6}' | awk -F'/' '{print $NF}'); do echo $f:;if [ ! -z $(ls ../directory/ | grep $f)   ];then echo exits;else echo DONT EXIST;fi;done')</span><br>

Give variable to the for loop and do something with it. In this case, give a string of pods names that you want to do something on:
<span class="code">read -p "pods:" pods;pods=$(echo ${pods} | sed 's/ /|/g') && read -p "command:" command && for s in $(kubectl get pods | awk -v awkvar="$pods" '$1 ~ awkvar {print $1}');do kubectl $command pod $s;echo;done</span><br>
