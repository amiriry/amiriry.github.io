<h4>What can be done very easy in linux?</h4>
<p>
Some stuff that I encounter that everyone should know<br>

	<h4 class="header">Find lines that contains a string and comes after another line</h4>
	This was a bit complicated explanation<br>
	What do I mean?<br>
	I had a situation where I needed to find files with certain names that contains a line that comes after another line!<br>
	And more clearly:<br>
	<span class="command">for f in $(find . -iname &lt;name> -type f);do echo $f:;sed -n '/<regexp1>/,$ p' $f | grep -i &lt;regexp2>;done</span><br>
	&bull;  Find specific files.<br>
	&bull;  In it print from a specific regular expression to the end<br>
	&bull;  Then find the line of the second regular expression - here we implement the part 'only after another line'<br>
	&bull;  And in the end, it shows only the files that contain this pattern.

	<h4 class="header">Input multiple variables in one command</h4>
	This one came to me when creating my own alarm clock. I wanted to separate hours, minutes and seconds from the same line read from input file.<br>
	The time look like this:<br>
	<span class="command">17:25:06</span><br>
	So I had to find a way to separate the fields and take them one by one as arguments.<br>
	They command to do that:<br>
	<span class="command">read -r year month day &lt; &lt;(date "+%Y:%m:%d" | awk -F':' '{print $1, $2, $3}')</span><br>
	This will give you 3 parameters with corresponding values for year, month and day.<br>
	You can of course use it for any command you want.<br>

	<span class="date">13.10.2022 - 17:54 - Thursday</span>
	<h4 class="header">Backup a file in interval you want - for regular backups while working</h4>
	Did you ever got to a situation where you needed to backup a file a lot of times once in few seconds/minutes?<br>
	Who have the time or the power to run <span class="command">cp &lt;file>&lt;id></span> each time? <span class="tab1">(&lt;id> for some identification of this specific backup)</span><br>
	You have to remember to do that and to find the easiest way to indentify the backup. The basic way is time.<br>
	So lets do it multiple times, and become a backup master! who only knows how to do one command  :(<br>
	Instead, you can do this trick:<br>
	<span class="command">while true;do cp <file> backups/&lt;file>$(date "+%H%M%S");sleep 60;done</span><br>
	This command will keep creating backups with an interval you choose (in this case 60 seconds), and the most useful thing: its identification will be with the time it is created.<br>
	You can open new terminal with this command, open new pane in tmux (or any other terminal manager), or put it in the background with '&' in the end of the command.<br>
	<span class="h4-text">Such low effort for doing something very useful.</span><br><br>
