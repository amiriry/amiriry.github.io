<h4>What can be done very easy in linux?</h4>

Some stuff that I encounter that everyone should know<br>

<h4 class="header">Define output of a command as environment variables</h4>
Sometimes you have some variables inside a file that you want to be sources.<br>
Like if for example you have a parameters file for charts, and you only need a specific charts parameters.<br>
You want it to be sourced in the middle of a script, ot any other thing.<br>
In that case you need to source only the output of the command that gets you these variables:<br>
<div class="command">grep CHART_NAME variablesfile.txt</div>
output
<div class="command">
	CHART_name=&lt;name><br>
	CHART_VERSION=&lt;version><br>
	SPECIFIC_CHART_INFO=&lt;info>
</div><br>
Just put <span class="command">source</span> at the begining of the command, and you'll get them as environmen variables:<br>
<div class="command">source &lt(grep CHART_NAME variablesfile.txt)</div><br>

<h4 class="header">When you want to curl something with spaces</h4>
	I needed to check some api of mine.<br>
	The input for this api was not my decisions to make, or it will take a lot of time to make it that way.<br>
	Part of them contain spaces.<br>
	So how to do a curl command (because that's the best wy to check apis with cli) that contain spaces?<br>
	Its not a hard questions for people who knows html... but its just a little tricky, so its place is in this page.<br>
	So if my server is on local computer and its open on port 8781 and I want to search for the sentence "This Is What I Search For"<br>
	Then do:<br>
	<div class="command">curl localhost:8781/Search/This%20Is%20What%I%20Search%For</div><br>

	<h4 class="header">Aggregate files in one file and separate them when needed</h4>
	I had a situation where I had a pod that was deleted pertty fast, and I had to take files from it <br>
	and copy directory didn't work for some reason :( <br>
	So as always, <span class="names1">for loop</span> came to the rescue!.<br><br>
	<div class="command">
		>> for f in $(ls);do echo "$f:" >> aggregated;cat $f >> aggregated;echo endoffile>> aggregated;done
	</div>
	Here I am going over all the files in the directory, and print them to a file with a specific separator "endoffile".<br>
	This can obviously be whatever you want.<br>
	I copied the file to my computer (at least I could do that...)<br>
	And then I separated all the files into multiple files(myfiles where html, use whatever regular expression that meets your needs):<br>
	<div class="command">for f in $(egrep -Ris "\.html:" aggregated;do cat aggregated | sed -n "/$f:/,/endoffile/ p" | head -n -1 > $f;done )</div>
	If I write the needed commands before the pod is up, I just copy them and I don't need <br>
	more than a second or 2 to get all the files that were in the directory.<br>
	You can use that in any situtation that you need to copy a lot of files very fast<br><br>

<h4 class="header">Put everything together - Autocompletion with for loop</h4>
	A lot of my tricks are for saving time.<br>
	This trick is not different :)<br><br>

	For a task that I did, I wanted to know the capacity of the workers of 10 different clusters in openshift...<br>
	Seems like a tedious task<br>
	<span class="names2">BUT!!!</span> its not that tedious, or even very very easy if you use a command with autocompletion(<a href="control_everything_command.html">Autocompletion Post</a>) and for loops(<a href="for-loop-cmds.html">For loops Post</a>) together!<br>
	Lets assume you already have a command that does everything, and you just add it a subcommand that connects to cluster by number, lets call it <div class="command">clusterconnectbynum</div>
	You give it a number and it connects to the cluster.<br>
	So you only need to do 
	<div class="command">poiuytrewq clusterconnectbynum &lt;number&gt;</div>
	When you are connected to the cluster, first you have to find all worker nodes, lets assume their name starts with <span class="names1">"workernode"</span>.<br> 
	After you found them you need to do the right jsonpath query on each one of them, to get capacity.<br>
	So to sum it up, instead of getting into each cluster and do the command, you just need to do:<br>
	<div class="command">for i in $(echo 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10);do echo "$i";poiuytrewq clusterconnectbynum $i;for n in $(oc get nodes | grep "workernode" | awk '{print $1}');do echo "$n";oc get nodes $n -o jsonpath='{.status.capacity}';done</div><br>
	And again - for comes to the rescues, now as for within for.

	<h4 class="header">Open multiple terminals and do a command on each</h4>
	Very easy to do if you track my tricks, but still something that I needed to do once to see that it works.<br>
	<div class="command">for i in $(seq 1 5);do gnome-terminal -- /bin/bash -c 'echo aaaa;read';done</div><br>

	<span class="date">02.01.2023 - 18:34 - Wednesday</span>
	<h4 class="header">Redicredt printed lines into file - print mlutiple lines to file</h4>
	I always wanted to have a script that writes files, however I want, and not line by line with redirection.<br>
	Today I found the way, and I already wrote about it but forgot.<br>
	<div class="code">
		cat &lt;&lt;EOF > file <br>
		This is going to be a file<br>
		All of this is going to be written to a file <br>
		as one file and not line by line.<br>
		In this case you don't have to write lines after line with redirection as I did before<br>
		EOF
	</div><br>
	You can look at an example of creating a repo, with sed commads, editing, adding or removing lines with cli commands<br>

	<span class="date">02.01.2023 - 17:32 - Monday</span>
	<h4 class="header">Take from output line by number and more lines by text</h4>
	Did you ever got to a situation where you wanted to do grep to two lines, but one of them is by its numebr?<br>
	In my case I wanted to have the output of <span class="command">kubectl get pods</span>  with grep on some name, and have the headers too.<br>
	After a bit of struggeling I got to this command:<br>
	<div class="command">kubectl get deploy | awk 'NR==1 || /some_pod_name/'</div>
	In this case, you will get the first line, that contains the headers, and the pods that contains the name you put inside '//'.<br>
	Now think about how much complicated it can get....<br>
	You can learn all about it in the blog post on awk.<br>

	<h4 class="header">Find lines that contains a string and comes after another line</h4>
	This was a bit complicated explanation<br>
	What do I mean?<br>
	I had a situation where I needed to find files with certain names that contains a line that comes after another line!<br>
	And more clearly:<br>
	<span class="command">for f in $(find . -iname &lt;name> -type f);do echo $f:;sed -n '/<regexp1>/,$ p' $f | grep -i &lt;regexp2>;done</span><br>
	&bull;  Find specific files.<br>
	&bull;  In it print from a specific regular expression to the end<br>
	&bull;  Then find the line of the second regular expression - here we implement the part 'only after another line'<br>
	&bull;  And in the end, it shows only the files that contain this pattern.

	<h4 class="header">Input multiple variables in one command</h4>
	This one came to me when creating my own alarm clock. I wanted to separate hours, minutes and seconds from the same line read from input file.<br>
	The time look like this:<br>
	<span class="command">17:25:06</span><br>
	So I had to find a way to separate the fields and take them one by one as arguments.<br>
	They command to do that:<br>
	<span class="command">read -r year month day &lt; &lt;(date "+%Y:%m:%d" | awk -F':' '{print $1, $2, $3}')</span><br>
	This will give you 3 parameters with corresponding values for year, month and day.<br>
	You can of course use it for any command you want.<br>

	<span class="date">13.10.2022 - 17:54 - Thursday</span>
	<h4 class="header">Backup a file in interval you want - for regular backups while working</h4>
	Did you ever got to a situation where you needed to backup a file a lot of times once in few seconds/minutes?<br>
	Who have the time or the power to run <span class="command">cp &lt;file>&lt;id></span> each time? <span class="tab1">(&lt;id> for some identification of this specific backup)</span><br>
	You have to remember to do that and to find the easiest way to indentify the backup. The basic way is time.<br>
	So lets do it multiple times, and become a backup master! who only knows how to do one command  :(<br>
	Instead, you can do this trick:<br>
	<span class="command">while true;do cp <file> backups/&lt;file>$(date "+%H%M%S");sleep 60;done</span><br>
	This command will keep creating backups with an interval you choose (in this case 60 seconds), and the most useful thing: its identification will be with the time it is created.<br>
	You can open new terminal with this command, open new pane in tmux (or any other terminal manager), or put it in the background with '&' in the end of the command.<br>
	<span class="h4-text">Such low effort for doing something very useful.</span><br><br>
