What is Math? and Why Math?<br>

<h3 class="names1"><span style="border-style: solid;padding: 10px">Trying to explain what is god!!!</span></h3>
<br>
This is what it is for me.<br>
---<br>
Its not about how the world is, its about <span class="names2">how we built it</span>. Its about how we keep building it everyday.<br>
How we make an entirely <span class="names2">unknown world a little more sensible</span>. Not for cats or sharks, but for us.<br>
How everything is already <span class="names2">modeled</span> in our heads, so lets <span class="names2">model the models</span>.<br>
How we model it every second, and don't even notice that.<br>

<h3>Why do we need math?</h3>
This questions bring us to an earleir question: Why do we need numbers?<br>
I think that numbers and the ability to manipulate them is an evolutionary advantage for everything.<br><br>

<h3 class="underline">Story 1</h3>
You are in the jungle, all of the tribe went to find some food. Lets assume you only need one apple to survive a day.<br>
Lets assume your tribe contains 5 people.<br>
First of all you need to know the concept of addition for that - 5 men means - 1 apples 5 times.<br>
Even more than that, if you know addition, if you encountered a large apple tree you will bring at least 2 for each man in your tribe, and even hide one for you.<br>
Now you know that you can survive 3 days! and you also got familiar with the concept of stealing <i class="fa-solid fa-thumbs-down"></i>.<br>
Surviving 3 more days, and more than that, means less stress, less hunger, and a lot of other good things. That's why we don't go hunting and gather food,<br> 
but we have agriculture.<br>
Now think of this idea in <span class="h3-text names2">ANY OTHER ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE</span><br>
Counting at first, an number manipulation are such powerful tools.<br><br>

<h3 class="underline">Story 2</h3>
Before all of this story, we have the ability to put things in group an call them names.<br>
<div class="tab1">- 2 People - Me and my sister, me and a stranger - when we are called 2, so many things can be done with us, everything that can be done with numbers,<br> 
<span class="tab2">can be tought of doing with us.</span><br>
- 2 Items - Me ,my dog and my car or me my cat and a wall.. cannot be thought of together in any kind of way. But the number 3 groups each of this items together as <span class="tab2">something that can be treated in a way.</span><br>
</div>
For example, an elevator, can have no more than 200kg on it.<br>
Seems so easy to calculate, but 200kg of what? of kids? of elephants? of kids and adults?<br>
You have a group called "things that have wieght", you measure the weight of each one of those and calculate it together.<br>
Here you only consider items with wieght attribute, and that's their way to be calculated for entering the elevator.<br>
The fact that you group all the items together, by attribute, that's a huge deal.<br>
Now think of the next attribute: <span class="names1">EXISTANCE</span><br>
And think what you can do with it or with any other attribute you pick.<br>
---<br>
That's why basic math is such an evolutionary advantage, and after that why hieghr math is such a powerfull tool for us humans -<br>
<span class="names1">Its a system that can create model for everything that have the attribute EXISTANCE!</span><br>
---<br>
And another important thing, <span class="names1">WHY MATH WORKS?</span> <br>
As its a figment of our imagination, and it models everyting that exists, we forget sometimes that everything that exists, exist in our brains.<br>
So obviously some system that models everything in our brain, and our brain contain all the concepts of everything that "exists" math can model everything that "exist".<br>
