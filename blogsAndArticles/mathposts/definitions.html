<h3 class="underline">Intro to definitions</h3>
After talking on more phylosopihcal ideas about math in <a href="whyandwhat.html">What is Math? Why Math?</a> and <a href="inifinity.html">infinity</a>.<br>
Lets start being <span class="names1">PRACTICAL</span>.<br>
Why do I start practice with definitions?<br>
Like the linux old saying "<span class="names2">linux is failes and files are everything</span>".<br>
The same with definition - <span class="names1">math is definitions and definitions are everything</span>.<br>
So math seems pretty easy now :) <br>
But, as said, defintions are everything, so we need to definie what do I mean by defintions, and how do I use those defintions.<br><br>
In the post on infinity we already defined infinity.<br>
Its wasn't easy, or that clear, and anyway, no matter what you define, to make it part of the mathematical system you have to agree on some basic rules.<br>
What are the rules?<br>
I don't know.<br>
I know when I am clearly inside them, I know when I am clearly out of them,<br>
but when I am in the grey area, I make mistakes... so, I really don't know.<br>
Most of the times definitions are built on other definitions, so step by step, defintion built on another, math can become very complex....<br><br>
<span class="underline">Example</span><br>
Lets take limit of a series as an example.<br>
The series is &nbsp;<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>n</sub></span>.<br>
The limit is defined as the number this series is approaching to as n going to infinity<br>
The way to write it in math is:<br>
