<h4>Infinity</h4><small> - I am going to use sympy lib to represnt all math here</small><br>

<h2>What is inifity?</h2>
First of all, I think that it is one of the most beautiful concepts in math. It can build mountains and define world smaller than microns all together.<br>
And to the more practical things:<br>
Its sgin is: <span style="font-size: 50px;">&infin;</span><br>
But what does that mean?<br>
You have multiple ways to look at it, but the main ways that are used the most. and are the most practical, I think are:<br>
<div class="tab1">
	1.<br>
	You can look at it as a process, some kind of a model for an unending process.<br>
	If you want to define a process that never stops - define it with infinity.<br>
</div><br><br>
<div class="tab1">
	2.<br>
	You can look at it as a number.<br>
	The biggest number exist.<br><br>
</div><br>
But what does that mean?<br>
Lets try to combine those ways. To get the bigger picture<br><br>


<span class="underline h3-text">Example1</span><br>
Lets try to find the biggest number exists.<br>
Obviously, we cannot think of one... No matter how hard we search for it, no matter what number we choose,<br>
we can find a number that is bigger than it if we only do the simple task of adding 1...<br>
---<br>
So instead of finding the biggest number exist, lets define the process of finding it.<br>
<span class="names1">You encountered a number? take a number that is bigger than it.</span><br>
And now define some aspect of infinity.<br>
The definition of this so called span.<span class="names1">"BIGGEST"</span> define in it some process.<br><br>
If we define anything for this "number" called inifinity, it means that no matter how far we got he definition still occurs.<br>
That's why we don't need this exact number, like 1,2,3, and that's how we treat inifinity as some kind of a "process" too.<br><br>
For example something that happens:<br>
o . When we get close to a number:<br>
x &rarr; 1<br>
x &rarr; 0<br>
2. When we try to get infinity:<br>
x &rarr; &infin; <br><br>

All of them are some kind of inifity.<br>
If you are approaching a number, just substract from the number the number we are approaching to and multiply by (-1), and you get approaching to zero.<br>
For example - approaching 4 from the "right" side means:<br>
... 4.1, 4.09, 4.08, 4.07, 4.06 ...... 4.0000000000001 .... <br>
And if you substract the fixed part - 4, you get:<br>
... 0.1, 0.09, 0.08, 0.07, 0.06 ....... 0.0000000000001 .... <br><br>

If you approach from the "left" side, multiple everything by (-1) and you ge approaching to zero from the "left" side<br>
... 3.9, 3.91, 3.92, 3.93, 3.94 ....... 3.9999999999991 .... <br>
Substract -4, multiple by (-1):<br>
... -0.1, -0.9, -0.8, -0.7, -0.6 ....... -0.000000000001 ... <br><br>


Approaching to zero can be looked at a fixed number devided by a number that id getting bigger:<br>
1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 .... 0.0000000000000001 ...<br>
If you look at the denominator of these numbers you will see that its growing.<br>
1, 10, 100, 1000 ... 10000000000000000 ...<br>

It will happen with every sequence of numbers that is getting close to zero - If you have a fixed value in the numeratorm the denominator will grow.<br>
So again, the process that changes the number is the unending growth of the denominator - approaching infinity.<br>
In the end of all of this, everything revolves around what inifinity represents.<br>
