<h4>Infinity</h4><small> - I am going to use sympy lib to represnt all math here</small><br>

<h2>What is inifity?</h2>
Its sgin is: <span style="font-size: 50px;">&infin;</span><br>
But what does that mean?<br>
You can look at it as a process, some kind of a model for an unending process.<br>
If you want to define a process that never stops - define it with infinity.<br><br>
<span class="underline h3-text">Example1</span><br>
Lets try to find the biggest number exists.<br>
Obviously, we cannot think of one... No matter how hard we search for it, we can find a number that is bigger than him if we only do the simple task of adding 1...<br>
So if we now we can add a number to whatever number we find. <br>
---<br>
So instead of finding the biggest number exist, lets define the process of finding it.<br>
<span class="names1">You encountered a number? take a number that is bigger than it.</span><br>
And now define something for infinity.<br>
BUT HOW CAN WE IF IT DOESN'T EXIST??!!!<br>
As the process above, if we define something for inifinity, it means that no matter how far we go the definition still exist.<br>
That's how, instead of defining what happens exactly at a place we don't know (infinity) we define a process that happens in "infinity"<br>
For example something that happens:<br>
1. When we get close to a number:<br>
x &rarr; 1<br>
x &rarr; 0<br>
2. When we try to get infinity:<br>
x &rarr; &infin; <br>

All of them are some kind of inifity.<br>
If you are approaching a number, just substract the fixed number and you get approaching to zero.<br>
Approaching to zero is just 1 devided by infinity in some way. <br>
In the end of all of this, everything revolves around what inifinity represents.<br>
And as said, it represent some process, that if you follow, some definition happens to all item you get.<br>
