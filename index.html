    <p>
	Hi, My name is Amir Shkedy. I am a devops, I am asked a lot what is that, what do I mean by that?
	My answer is, that I am the guy you go to when you want to find a solution for complicated problems.
	But what do I do in my day to day job?
	Well, I am the one who untie nots, When I am in the middle of a mess, I organize it.
	When I tackle a problem I'm not just trying to solve, I am also trying to do that in the best way possible. 
	Whether it with a code, a command, an strieght answer. 
	A solution that I can reproduce in thousands of places at once. 

	Whether I take an existing solution and modify it to solve the current problem, or juts create a whole new solution that no one ever thought of.
	To sum it up, I just solve problems in the best possible.

	This is the first edition of my website - In the future it will be much more beautiful
