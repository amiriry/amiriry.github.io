<h4>What can be done very easy in linux?</h4>

Some stuff that I encounter that everyone should know

		<h4 class="header">Reclick - refresh without doing anything, or even notice</h4>
		Did you ever had to refresh the screen multiple times to see the result? 
		For example when you started a machine in the cloud and wanted to get to "working" state, but you had to press refresh time and time again.<br>
		Each time you have to take the cursor from where you are to the place where the refresh is and come back to where you were before.<br>
		In addition, you had to change context multiple times.<br>
		There's a script you can use to do that <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amiriry/Linux/main/scripts/reclick.sh" target="_blank">here</a><br>
		First of all install xdotool <span class="command">>> apt install xdotool</span>
	</div>
	<span class="command">>> read -r cx cy < <(xdotool getmouselocation | awk -F'[ :]' '{print $2 , $4}')</span> - Read from mouslocation, current x and y. This command reads first two variables that comes from the command in the parentheses.<br>
	<span class="reclick-secondline">Then you are asked to move to the location in the screen where you want to click multiple times</span><br>
	<span class="command">>> read -r gx gy < <(xdotool getmouselocation | awk -F'[ :]' '{print $2 , $4}')</span> - Take the coordinates where you want to go<br>
	<span class="command">>> xdotool mousemove $cx $cy</span> - Move to where the script was started - current place<br>
	Then you are asked for the delay between clicks.<br>
	In the end, a while loop that take saves your current place, as above, and moves back and forth between your current place and the goto place in intermission of the time you mentioned for delay.

		<h4 class="header">Copy from cli output straight to clipboard</h4>
		When you work with linux, a lot of times you have to copy someoutput to use it somewhere else. Not just redirecting, woe piping which is easy, but take the output and put it in some other application.<br>
		Most of the time you have to do it by hand, and it might get exhuasting if you have to copy a lot of text to some mail or other GUI application.<br>
		The solution: Create an alias that uses a command that knows how to work with clipboard, that takes the output from the command and put it in clipboard automatically.<br>
		The command is <span class="command">xclip</span>.<br>
		There are 2 options for the alias, one with new line copied and one without(The output have new-line character in the end):<br>
	</div>
	<div class="command">
		>> alias cp2clip='xclip -selection clipboard'<br>
		>> alias cp2clip-nonl="tr -d '\n' | xclip -selection clipboard"<br>
	</div>
	Now it can be used piped to some other command to get its output to the clipboard:
	<div class="command">
		>> echo "some thing to copy to blipboard" | cp2clip
	</div>
	Now you can use <span class="ctrl-key">ctrl+v</span> to paste it wherever you want
	<br><br>

		<h4 class="header">Using '#' to remember a command</h4>
		When you start writing a command and in the middle of it you realize that you need something from other command, som output.<br>
		What I used to do is to do <span class="ctrl-key">ctrl+c</span> and do the other command I need, and then start writing the command again.<br>
		This can get very frustrating if you wrote a very long command<br>
		Solution: Go to the begining of the line with <span class="ctrl-key">ctrl+a</span> and put '#'. Press enter and you have the command saved in your history to use whenever you want.
	</div><br>
	For example, in the middle of this command you realized you need some other security group with some id <num>:
	<div class="command">
		>> aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name my-sg --description "My security group"
	</div>
	So you do <span class="ctrl-key">ctrl+a</span> then '#' and then Enter:
	<div class="command">
		>> #aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name my-sg --description "My security group"<br>
		>>
	</div>
	Search for the group you need:
	<div class="command">
		>> aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].{Name:GroupName,ID:GroupId}" | grep &lt;num>
	</div>
	Then you go just one command up in history and can fill in the blank
